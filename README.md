# Hand-written digit recognization from scratch

## Description
We will learn a basic topic of Deep learning is **Neural Network** by building a Neural Network to recognize the hand-written digit. Moreover, we will use the simple architecture of Neural Network: Fully-connected Feed-forward Neural Network and build it from scratch without any machine learning libraries support (such as *Keras*, *Pytorch* or *Tensorflow*) for deeply understanding.

From that, we'll apply it to build an desktop application for recognizing hand-written digit.
